If I were completely open (in terms of accessibility of any and all data which my body and mind store and consist of), I would essentially not exist because I (i.e. my body and mind) would be a hole all dimensions. 

By implication, in order for me to exist (as the unique hardware and software combination I am), I would need to contain and be comprised of information which is not entirely public (i.e. accessible to all frames of reference and to all information processing agents (either simultaneously or asynchronously)).

Idea: let the "blue collar" workers recieve an unconditional basic income sufficient to live on while "white collar" workers keep working to help pay for that unconditional basic income and, also, allocate a substantial portion of what is already spent on the United States of America's military sector towards funding that universal basic income. Eventually all "blue collar" jobs will be outsourced to robots (which means the total number of people receiving that unconditional basic income will not keep growing after a certain point in human civilization's history).

Note that, in the context of this web page, "blue collar" implicitly refers to any job which humans want performed and which can be entirely automated (i.e. performed entirely by artificially intelligent machines). By contrast, "white collar" (in the context of this web page) implicitly refers to any job which humans want performed and which humans want to perform.
