To Whom It May Concern:

I no longer think my parents nor my hometown or larger encompassing home region neighbors are or ever have done anything to me which I can say with sufficient confidence was deliberately to my detriment. In fact, as I have been retrospecting about events which occurred across my entire remembered lifespan, I have recalled many instances of my family, friends, and community being supportive of my goals and preferences (and to an extent I think is fair and humane for all parties to the greatest extent possible).

What really has been of interest to me lately (and which might as well be what I consider to be the core idea mentioned in this blog post) is the idea (and role play that the idea is true) of free will being entirely an illusion and all people (and other information processing agents) being controlled from the outside-in by deterministic forces which govern the entire known cosmos (according to the perspective of the humanoid author writing this note (and that author is named karbytes)). Then, if I role play (i.e. pretend for the sake of conducting thought experiments and perhaps even increasing the likelihood that outcomes I favor will occur) that each human has zero volition (and is hence a puppet of the entire encompassing universe or cosmos), I find it impossible to logically justify holding a grudge or prolonging angry feelings which are directed towards specific information processing agents or general processes in nature due to the fact that all phenomena are presumed by role play me to emerge unintentionally and as a product of all processes which are occurring throughout the entire universe or multiverse (i.e. set of multiple disjointed or connected universes which may either occur simultaneously or else in a chronologically non-overlapping manner (from that multiverse's frame of reference)).

I consider my emotions, thoughts, desires, and (goal-oriented or otherwise) behavior to be a microcosmic form of weather or pattern of celestial events such as cyclical expansion and contraction of finite or infinite space-time containing some finite or infinite amount of energy-matter within it. That seems to be a more personally satisfying alternative to construing such first-person subjective qualia as some type of diseased material to be quarantined, denatured, or removed.

I feel (rationally) optimistic to be alive! My motto for life might as well be the continous pursuit of increasingly optimal states of existence (and uses of consciousness) and the prolonging of such a pursuit towards a timespan which approaches infinity.

Sincerely,
karbytes
