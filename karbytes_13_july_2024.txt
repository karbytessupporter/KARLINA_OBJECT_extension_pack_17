from pydub import AudioSegment

# Path to the audio file
audio_path = "path_to_your_file/karbytes_at_warm_springs_bart_station_17_february_2023.mp3"

# Convert mp3 to wav
sound = AudioSegment.from_mp3(audio_path)
sound.export("converted.wav", format="wav")

# Initialize recognizer
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

# Convert wav to audio data
with sr.AudioFile("converted.wav") as source:
    audio_data = recognizer.record(source)

# Recognize speech using Google Web Speech API
try:
    text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)
    print("Transcription: ", text)
except sr.UnknownValueError:
    print("Google Web Speech API could not understand the audio.")
except sr.RequestError as e:
    print(f"Could not request results from Google Web Speech API; {e}")

If you prefer an online tool, you can upload the file to a service like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or any other transcription service. Let me know if you need more assistance with this!

import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk

def recognize_from_audio(audio_file):
    speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(subscription="YourAzureSubscriptionKey", region="YourAzureRegion")
    audio_input = speechsdk.AudioConfig(filename=audio_file)
    speech_recognizer = speechsdk.SpeechRecognizer(speech_config=speech_config, audio_config=audio_input)
    
    result = speech_recognizer.recognize_once()
    
    if result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech:
        return result.text
    elif result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.NoMatch:
        return "No speech could be recognized"
    elif result.reason == speechsdk.ResultReason.Canceled:
        cancellation_details = result.cancellation_details
        return f"Speech Recognition canceled: {cancellation_details.reason}. Error details: {cancellation_details.error_details}"

audio_path = "C:/path_to_your_file/karbytes_at_warm_springs_bart_station_17_february_2023.mp3"
sound = AudioSegment.from_mp3(audio_path)
sound.export("converted.wav", format="wav")

transcription = recognize_from_audio("converted.wav")
print("Transcription: ", transcription)

Replace "YourAzureSubscriptionKey" and "YourAzureRegion" with your actual Azure subscription key and region.

Summary

The following text was output to the command line after the Python script was run.

Transcription:  and lit a car lights on the seventeenth of february he doesn't drink for you live at warm springs varsity occurring on

I was told by ChatGPT-4o that offline speech-to-text transcription services are not as likely to accurately transcribe audio files as are cloud-based services. I will probably play around with such cloud-based services later and develop more sophisticated Python applications. The application featured in this journal entry is considered by me to be merely a "hello world" app instead of something I feel is more deserving of being showcased in my SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_PORTFOLIO web page of this website.

Lastly, I was (during this session) not able to use the command python instead of python3 to execute the Python script which (badly (but not so badly the output bares no resemblance to the actual spoken message in the input audio file)) transcribed the input audio file.
