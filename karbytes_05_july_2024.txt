To Whom It May Concern:

I think that I am a schizoid (and I prefer to be a schizoid for as long as I live). 

By my own definition, a schizoid is a person who does not need attention nor affection nor approval from other people in order to feel existentially complete and emotionally content. 

People who are not me and who I perceive to be (and pretend are) information processing agents inhabitating the same environment as I am are (intrapersonally) treated by me as "philosophical zombies" (i.e. entirely unconscious robots which mimic the behavior of (relatively) conscious information processing agents such as myself (and with the implication being that I am the only conscious entity inhabitating the aforementioned environment)).

Sincerely,
karbytes
