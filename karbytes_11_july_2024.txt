Without going into explicit detail, I recall (to my surprise and disappointment) many near-daily instances of many more men than women (who seem to be less educated than me) being intentionally rude to me and occasionally even resorting to initiating physical violence against me and physical vandalism of my property within the past four years more so than in less recent periods of my lifetime. I consider this to me "(poor and relatively uneducated) working class culture" being reactionary and regressive in response to recent advancements in computation and intellectual domains (particularly domains which prominently focus on natural sciences, quantitative reasoning, and formal logic).

I consider there to be some kind of war being waged on me to the extent that I consider myself to be a victim of ongoing and socially normalized and populist-condoned "hate crimes" and bullying. Rather than retaliate by "fighting fire with fire" (i.e. behaving in a manner which is similarly immature, belligerent, and physically endangering to myself and others as those who gang stalk and covertly or overtly bully me), my preferred strategy is to avoid interacting with populations I think are likely to side with my tormentors or to be my tormentors and to, instead, treat such people as savages who cannot (yet) be trusted to be rational nor empathic and who I "should" leave to fend for themselves (for better or for worse). I admit that I consider such people to be more deserving of being genocidally exterminated than those I consider to be of my current and ideal caliber. Hence, I think it is very likely that many people are eager (if not desperate) to cast me as a dangerously bigoted elitist snob and "anti-socialite". I invoke legal and philosophical appeals to minimal censorship and maximal freedom of personal expression and thought. I expect "authorities" to "read between the lines" of what I say (especially what I write and publish via my fully (intentionally by me visible to the) public (and public domain) blogging platform) to infer that I am not a legitimate threat to any person's safety nor basic civil liberties (because I am smart, dedicated to always getting smarter, and almost always willing to articulate my ideas in succinct yet comprehensive ways which invoke sufficient logical and empirical evidence). I doubt my tormentors have as powerful of a persuasive influence as I do on societal and cultural "authorities" (unless such "authorities" are appointed by and representing of my tormentors while contrarian and pejorative in their portrayal and interactions with me).

Bare in mind that I consider this note to be much lower quality than what I usually publish via my blog because this note is a byproduct of routine mental housecleaning activities (which I have already alluded to in past journal entries as "clearing the cache" of my working memory). I thought that it would be a good idea to share this note besuse it seems to offer genuine psychological closure for me about the aforementioned social dynamics which have caused me significant distress and inconvenience (and which I reacted to in the past (as recent as this morning) in ways I am not proud of (because such reactions from me demonstrated a lack of adherence to my personal standards in favor of allowing myself to become momentarily hijacked by lower-quality (yet popularly practiced) thuggery))). I hope and expect that this is the last time I will mention those attention whorish thugs in my blog. Such animals are presumably just as free as I am (legally and logistically) to express their own perspectives on their own personal platforms or artistic outlets. It may be several decades (if ever) before such "sub humans" get around to participating with full agency in the  knowledge sharing industry (which is more of a personal investment for them than is merely shit posting flippant bouts of incoherent and badly structured commentary on social media platforms and Internet forums).

Finally, I want to emphasize that I seem to notice significantly more of what I consider to be morally decent people than otherwise on a daily basis. I rarely mention what I consider to be good examples of humanity in my blog (even though I am confident that many of such examples exist and have enriched my quality of life in profound ways). Such people seem to attract attention and favor from other people without any use of violence, vandalism, nor physical coercion. By contrast, those I dismiss as savages seem to resent people other than themselves having autonomy and pleasure.
