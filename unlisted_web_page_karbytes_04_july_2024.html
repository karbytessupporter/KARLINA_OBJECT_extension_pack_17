<p>Warning: like many files which exist throughout the entire collection of public domain Internet-based files referred to as karbytes, this note may be satire or &#8220;garbage&#8221; gleaned from karbytes going through a routine &#8220;cleaning the cache&#8221; mental organization process&#8230;</p>
<p>It has taken me a while to finally admit this to the public via this blogging platform because I wanted to be sure that anything which I think is more personally important and hence more deserving of karbytes intellectual property real estate is published via this blogging platform first:</p>
<p>For at least two consecutive years, I have not experienced a single day in which &#8220;blue collar&#8221; people (99% male) did not (a) physically tamper with my equipment or with my utilities usage in a way which severely disrupts my workflow (and last night a crew of &#8220;blue men&#8221; cut the power lines to my house seemingly in &#8220;retaliation&#8221; for the note I published last night which dared to stray beyond what such &#8220;blue men&#8221; seem to think is socially acceptable), (b) go out of their way to place themselves in close physical proximity to me in order to say some verbal taunt (and often with small children in tow being used by the &#8220;adult&#8221; as tools to censor me and to lord over me the implication that most people think I deserve to be sacrificed so that he and his young minor dependent offspring and baby maker get to survive and thrive at my expense), and (c) use their cars while driving or idling on the side of the road in relatively close proximity to me along my path (as a pedestrian or as a cyclist) to honk at me, shine bright high beams in my face, drive slowly past me (and often following with a U-turn) in order to seemingly make me feel stalked and uncomfortably scrutinized, or drive quickly past me (and even swerving towards me as though about to hit me) seemingly deliberately in order to make me feel physically threatened, one-upped (by obviously more &#8220;powerful&#8221; apes), and coerced into staying in the shadows and away from where those hot-headed road hogs parade around in their noisy, oversized gasoline guzzling war tank machines. I forgot to add to that list the sound of such male apes frequently and loudly yelling in a plaintive and angry fashion but with few words (and always words which sound like an attempt to dismiss whatever I have to say or do as irrelevant or to diminish it in some way (and I liken it to being yelled at by stupid, pent up, chauvinistic, and immature little brats half my age (at least mentally) who hypocritically demand that I act more &#8220;chill&#8221; and dumbed down while they annoyingly brag about how &#8220;chill&#8221; and apathetic to my ideals they are (as if such braggery is supposed to seduce hot young bimbo ladies into having sex with them)).</p>
<p>Boys will be boys! The best think I know to do about this situation is to expect it to occur on a near daily basis for at least the next five years (if not for the remainder of my lifespan). Such people are not seemingly interested in stopping such antics anytime soon (because they seem resistant to and even encouraged by my attempts to get them to stop through diplomacy and even use of militaristic force) and such people seem to be stubbornly devoted to such practices and identities because it makes them seem &#8220;alpha&#8221;, &#8220;in control&#8221;, &#8220;ungovernable by others&#8221;, &#8220;a threat&#8221;, and &#8220;a turn on for the ladies&#8221;. The guys must know at some level that they each need a cisgendered female wife and at least two biological offspring through her to seriously earn his keep and to bolster himself against intentional entropy of human beings (who clearly think that the nuclear family households which produce non-bastardized biological offspring who grow up to become able-bodied adults who also contribute to society by working in socially acceptable roles and procuring non-bastardized biological offspring). I see how severely outnumbered I am in terms of social and economic support. Hence, I expect that my chances of dying relatively young (especially from preventable causes) is significantly higher than it if is for those adults who are members of those aforementioned baby-making &#8220;nuclear family&#8221; households. I will still nevertheless do everything in my power to maximize my lifespan and enjoyment of life (even though many humans seem to be vehemently opposed to that (which makes sense because, in an &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; in which material resources are in more demand than there is supply for such material resources, those aforementioned households should be given first priority access to all basic necessities because only those households are providing the means to sustain a functional human society (excluding the idea that human adult lifespans and physiological capabilities can technically be extended for indefinitely long time periods using replacement tissues cultivated from a patient&#8217;s own stem cells))).</p>
<p>(Despite what I mentioned in the previous paragraph about extending human lifespans using stem cell technologies (which can significantly reduce the need for humans to give birth to new humans at rates which were historically in proportion to (but increasingly exceeding) the rate at which humans died), I think most humans are adamently opposed to anything other than the &#8220;status quo&#8221; of &#8220;high turnover rate of human population and low retention of individual knowledge&#8221; because such a &#8220;status quo&#8221; ensures that women and children remain easy for the men to program and control (because women and children are hardly allowed to take a break from each other and hence ingest the same garbage culture and intellectual and experiential vacuum as mere dependents of working men who lord over them with &#8220;superior&#8221; wealth, street smarts, esoteric or technical knowledge, and brute strength (minus the physical signifiers that one is not quite okay to walk alone at night nor to live alone in any capacity))).</p>
<p>(Related to what I said in the previous paragraph is the way so many of those &#8220;blue men&#8221; act as though only They are allowed to travel freely and hang out comfortably in any space (but especially in places which are considered to be public or outdoors (but most women seem to have to share a household with a man in order to have a roof over their heads other than a jail or mental hospital or &#8220;damaged goods&#8221; shelter)). Such &#8220;blue men&#8221; frequently manifest as slightly to moderately overweight and short-haired loiterers who walk with a swagger or fake limp and sport a baseball cap with the bill facing forward. They look like people who would quickly pounce on the opportunity to engage in a physical brawl because they seem so agitated and bored and attention whorish (much like their wimmin). I am afraid of such brutes and have learned to stay away from them and to not say or do anything which might come across as a taunt to them. I fear getting beaten up, my stuff getting vandalized, and them otherwise tampering with my life in ways which cause me significant distress. What keeps me optimistic and forward-moving with my goals is the momentum I built up from establishing my own intellectual property platform (i.e. karbytes) and the community and informational and material resources I have found as a result of passionately and diligently pursuing my goals (which generally amount to lifelong personal development towards boundless self actualization and optimization)).</p>
<p>It is probably easier and more socially acceptable to be little more than a &#8220;blue collar&#8221; worker or poorer spouse of such than it is to do what I think comes more easily to me and which seems more congruent with my sensibilities about what is modern and ethical: &#8220;white collar&#8221;. In order to prevent my &#8220;careerism&#8221; from getting sabotaged by the insideously jealous control freaks who are intimidated and rendered insecure because of my &#8220;careerism&#8221; (which leans heavily towards &#8220;white collar&#8221; (i.e. information age stuff) instead of towards &#8220;blue collar&#8221; (i.e. industrial age stuff), I treat my &#8220;careerism&#8221; as little more than a lifelong pursuit of self-paced and solitary learning instead of endeavors which require that I work in what is deemed to be a &#8220;white collar&#8221; setting for pay. By the looks of it, society hardly allows me the opportunity to work even part-time menial jobs (which has lead me to conclude that many people think I deserve to spend the majority of my lifetime in prison or on the street as a destitute beggar with no job nor connections to people willing to gift me money)).</p>
<p>Maybe what will happen is that the &#8220;blue men&#8221; will get their way and have the next two generations of humans be indoctrinated to shun anything which offends those &#8220;blue men&#8221; such that society turns into a streamlined surveillance state version of United States ideals about what the 1950s was supposedly about: the nuclear family household which strongly encouraged women to be stay-at-home wives and mothers and the men to be the sole bread winners of the family (where the Internet is replaced with television and stricter laws about what people are allowed to do with their bodies are enforced such that people become conditioned to think that no other way of life should be permitted than the idea the people should give birth to offspring and not try to live for too long after that).</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have already been told (and expect to be told again) many times that what I do via karbytes is irrelevant to society and to most of its constituent individuals, criminally self-indulgent (instead of appropriately self-depreciating and self-neglecting), and a burden to be allowed to exist in any form (because such resources could be allocated to what are deemed by the &#8220;moral majority&#8221; to be more worthy pieces of information than what I created). I am accustomed to being told to shut up and go away. Rather than do that, I usually insist on not shutting up and not going away (much to the dismay of many other people). That is why I have no friends and do not seek to make any friends. I only aim to be as cordial and interactive with other people as I think is necessary for my own ends. </p>
<p>Never forget that karbytes (the body of intellectual property) was created primarily for karbytes (the author of that body of intellectual property). Hence, karbytes content and practices will be primarily in service to the aforementioned author named karbytes. I eagerly anticipate my future selves reviewing the content which I have published via the karbytes intellectual property collection. Such intellectual property is assumed to be safely stored in a publicly accessible place in cyberspace known as the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a> at the Internet Archive.</p>
