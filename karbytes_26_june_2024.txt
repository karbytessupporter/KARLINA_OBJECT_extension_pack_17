On 26_JUNE_2024 at approximately 2:30PM, karbytes copied the entire digital information contents of each of the aforementioned optical discs onto karbytes’ primary laptop computer in order to verify that the aforementioned folder was successfully saved to its respective M_DISC.

The image at the following Uniform Resource Locator depicts two sets of three non-blank M_DISCs each inside of their labeled sheaths (where each of the two sets of exactly three M_DISCs encompasses the entire collection of public domain and Internet-based digital files which comprise the body of intellectual property named karbytes (as described by the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/ ) as karbytes was at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 25_JUNE_2024):

Below is ChatGPT-4o’s output when described by karbytes to describe the aforementioned image file:

The uploaded image shows a collection of labeled optical discs and a carrying case. There are six M-DISC optical discs arranged on a flat surface, along with a small blue carrying case positioned above the discs. The labels on the discs are handwritten in lowercase and read as follows:

1. Top left: “karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_8”

2. Top right: “karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_8”

3. Middle left: “karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_7”

4. Middle right: “karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_7”

5. Bottom left: “karbytes_20march2024_journals”

6. Bottom right: “karbytes_20march2024_journals”

The discs are organized in a neat manner, and the carrying case appears to be a portable, zippered case, likely intended for storing and protecting the discs. The background is a plain, smooth surface, possibly a tabletop or floor.
