<p>To Whom It Concerns:</p>
<p>I have narcissistic parents and live in a town which seems to be heavily populated with abusive assholes. (By narcissistic, I mean &#8220;unable or unwilling to pay adequate mind to perspectives other than one&#8217;s own nor to information which contradicts the idea that oneself is morally or logically sound&#8221;). I am simply trying to do the best I can to achieve my goals and to exemplify my ideals (which seem to conflict with what other people in my life think I ought to orient myself about). I hope to someday have the means to live in a housing unit which I do not have to share with other residents (or at least which I don&#8217;t have to share with people I think seriously hinder my progress towards personal goals). Right now I am unemployed and almost entirely financially dependent on my parents (who threaten to cut me off financial support as a means to control my personal expression such that I am extremely demure and submissive compared to how I prefer to express myself). At this time my relationship with my parents and home town &#8220;community&#8221; is strained (yet I still &#8220;foolishly&#8221; keep attempting to use my current legal address (which is my dad&#8217;s house) as a place to store my physical property, receive mail, take showers, wash my clothes, and even indulge in some musical instrument playing (and sometimes recording) and Internet usage (and I say that attempting to act that self sovereign and welcome in my own home is &#8220;foolish&#8221; given that many people with more social, economic, and militaristic power than what I have are almost always in close range to me (especially in my home town) and can hence wield their power in ways which cause me significant inconvenience)).</p>
<p>I will try to keep all my communications with other humans as drama-free, mutually respectful, efficient, useful, and minimal as possible. That is not to say I am an absolute misanthrope. I simply see the vast majority of my interactions with other people as mere means to achieve my materialistic ends (and I often feel resentful and disgusted and morose about having to deal with people whose behavior I find to be unnecessarily stressful, wasteful, hostile, or expensive (yet nevertheless insist on concealing my discontent about other people for the sake of getting things done as quickly, painlessly, and effectively as possible)).</p>
<p>I will try to stay away from my home town as often as I can afford to (but not to the extent that I&#8217;m effectively homeless (unless I am legally evicted)).</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
karbytes
