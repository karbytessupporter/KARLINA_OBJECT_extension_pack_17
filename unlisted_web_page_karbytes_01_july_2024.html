<p>For approximately two weeks, I have been eagerly awaiting my tentative start date with a new (contingent) warehouse job I was offered via Amazon in Fremont, California. That start date was supposed to be 4:30AM Pacific Standard Time on 01_JULY_2024. When I showed up this morning, I was told that my spot was filled due to the fact that my background check processing was delayed. (Some part of me feels obliged to insinuate that people other than myself are actively opposed to me getting and keeping a job because such people prefer that I be forced to remain much more destitute and beset with adversity than would otherwise be the case if left to my own devices without other people attempting to sabotage my attempts to become more financially self-sufficient).</p>
<p>I noticed that, many times throughout today when I have experienced what I consider to be an unusually high degree of personal salience in what I am mentally concentrating on, people driving by my outdoor sitting spot have coincidentally honked their horns (which my conspiracy-theory-generating mind cannot help but suspect is in immediate and direct response to whatever &#8220;thought crime&#8221; the passerby decided I committed and needed to be scolded for. (Related to what I said is me noticing within the past 48 hours especially chauvinist men in physical proximity to me seemingly chastising me for apparently being too physically or mentally energized, cerebral, introverted, or otherwise nonconformist and I heard such men exclaim that my ego is too big)).. </p>
<p>(I have been noticing a lot of loud, fast cars, angry (and loud) sounding tenor voices of their (mostly young male (and mostly Latino/Hispanic and to a lesser extent African American and to an ever lesser extent Caucasian and almost never Asian)) drivers, and a stifling amount of second-hand cigarette smoke in this area. It feels like a region dominated by belligerent chimpanzees disguised as humans on a rampage to suppress intellectual activity and anything else that does not explicitly subordinate itself to the proliferation of those &#8220;chimpanzees&#8221; using their patriarchal status to acquire as much material status objects, real estates, and utilization of human wombs as physically possible. Then again, I am prone to bouts of satire (and I wrote &#8220;worse&#8221; things earlier today in a private note which may have been intercepted by those chimpish &#8220;thought police&#8221; (which I mockingly sometimes refer to as &#8220;civilian cops&#8221; for the way they act at least as micro-managerial, chauvinistic, and violence-addicted as actual armed government employees sometimes are))).</p>
<p>What caused me to write this note was discovering that, after I left my bicycle parked at a bike lock immediately outside the Starbucks I frequent at Persimmons Place in Dublin, California today for less than three hours, someone or something caused the front tire (which I wholly replaced and upgraded last week for approximately $75) to rupture out of the wheel frame. When I beheld the mess in disgust, I heard some young guy who I have seen regularly hang out at that shopping center snicker condescendingly. Maybe he popped the tire. Maybe he is simply happy to see me unhappy (for reasons which are not entirely clear to me). Today&#8217;s tire popping is the fourth of such incidents within a two week period! I have never dealt with such frequent bike sabotage before but I have dealt with many instances of whole bikes getting stolen and many more instances of my tires getting ruptured seemingly as a result of some human other than myself deliberately puncturing the tire just to spite me when I&#8217;m not looking.</p>
<p>Though I plan to get my bicycle back in commission as soon as feasible (which I think I can do within the next 48 hours), I am more wary than ever of leaving my bicycle unattended in that Dublin area. Also, I noticed a lot of sharp objects such as shards of broken glass from alcoholic beverage containers littering the pathways my bike traverses. Finally, I noticed an usually high amount of other people loitering menacingly near my bicycle between errands today in that area as though the people loitering were trying to pick a fight with me (and I noticed there was a bolt on the ground near my bike which made me think that someone wanted me to interpret that bolt as a threat laid by some other person who is implicitly saying that they will tamper with my bicycle if I leave it in &#8220;their&#8221; turf (even though that area is technically a public area)).</p>
<p>Two images of the popped bike tire are available at the following twp Uniform Resource Locators:</p>

<p>Finally, I want to emphasize that my blogging platform &#8220;wants to&#8221; become increasingly focused on natural science, computer science, mathematics, metaphysics, and quantum mechanics. What that means is that subject matter which pertains to &#8220;social justice&#8221;, &#8220;law and order&#8221;, and other decidedly &#8220;human-centric&#8221; phenomena is not something my blogging platform really &#8220;wants to&#8221; make additional space for. That leads me to my next thought: the idea that the poor are the most responsible for the perpetuation of poverty (because such people seem to be more interested in making sure their competition does not &#8220;get ahead&#8221; than they are in personal development which would facilitate them &#8220;getting ahead&#8221; (and by &#8220;getting ahead&#8221;, I mean to imply &#8220;making progress towards personally and socially meaningful goals in a manner which is deemed to be most cost-effective and humane&#8221;)).</p>
<p>One last thing: my advice is for female-bodied humans to boycott having sexual, romantic, or financial bonds with those piggish &#8220;chimpanzee&#8221; men I described earlier in this note. I hope those vermin of humankind do not pass on their genes and do not get to exploit more women, children, and other vulnerable persons as human trafficking victims, indentured servants, and hostages coerced into feigning loyalty, subservience, and approval of such hideous, slovenly beasts. I cannot help but feel disgusted at such men succeeding at roping women into marrying them or having their offspring. I do not think those people should be given priority access to <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elysium</a> (or, if they are granted access, let it be on condition that those beasts get a vasectomy and not cut people in line who are in a better position to positively contribute to society instead of just loot it and defecate all over its public spaces). (*)</p>
<p>(Never forget that those poor, bored, and belligerent (sex and violence obsessed) chimp thugs have ample time and money on their hands to become proficient academics, artists, or entrepreneurs, but instead, those lazy sulking brats would seemingly rather spend most of their free time and discretionary money on stalking and picking fights with people like me. My &#8220;crime&#8221; in their eyes is simply &#8220;showing off&#8221; my smarts, self confidence, or optimistic and cheerful demeanor. Apparently, I am &#8220;supposed&#8221; to be too downtrodden as a result of having no job and too many enemies to exude such &#8220;boastful&#8221; qualities. I will continue to insist on living my preferred lifestyle instead of renouncing it in order to appease those misery mongering ass wipes which I cannot help but wish would drop dead within the next 24 hours. I think the world would be a happier and more peaceful and safe place without them in it).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>(*) One very important idea which I often try to get around to addressing in my blog more thoroughly is (a) the ideal I have of spending as much time as possible in solitude rather than in directly social contexts and, along with that solitude, (b) espousing a solipsistic and relatively impersonal (i.e. naturalistic more than anthropocentric) worldview. What that means is that, according to my ideals, a human being should not necessarily default to making marriage and baring biological offspring that person&#8217;s life plan. Instead, what I recommend all people do is spend ample time in solitude (especially in naturalistic settings such as out in the wilderness or in spaces which incorporate elements of nature such as in a garden) on a regular basis sufficient to allow one&#8217;s own creative insights to spontaneously emerge (according to Nature&#8217;s &#8220;higher&#8221; timing and not necessarily in accordance to some human-centric agenda). The intelligence which is inherent in Nature is assumed to be ubiquitous and on a larger time scale than what human conceptualizations traditionally allow for. Also, such intelligence is assumed to be from the same Source (though it is possible for relatively finite beings such as human individuals to &#8220;corrupt&#8221; such intelligence by limiting such intelligence to being used for relatively shallow, unsatisfying, and ill-informed purposes).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">If most humans valued solitude, self-sufficiency, and pursuit of true, accurate, and complete knowledge at least as much as I do, then I think human civilization would be riddled with much fewer interpersonal conflicts, animal welfare abuses, ecological destruction, and lopsided economic distribution. That is because people would generally be more in touch with that ubiquitous &#8220;field&#8221; of intelligence whose ultimate source is Nature.</span> Being sufficiently aware of and ethically aligned with that &#8220;force&#8221; makes it virtually impossible for a person to voluntarily want to engage in those aforementioned health-destroying and harmony-destroying behaviors because engaging in those behaviors would seem as self-evidentially absurd as is cutting off one&#8217;s own limbs and gouging out one&#8217;s own organs. A human who loves <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature</a> and sees itself as a part of Nature assumedly does not want to cut itself off from Nature because that would be like a cell in a multicellular organism voluntarily turning into a cancer cell instead of voluntarily continuing to be a healthy, cohesive, and functional part of that multicellular macro-organism. Besides, being a healthy, cohesive, and functional part of that multicellular organism extends the lifespan and capabilities of that individual cell. By contrast, turning into a rogue cancer cell does shortens the lifespan and reduces the agency of that cell and that cell&#8217;s entire encompassing multi-cellar organism of an ecosystem.</p>
<p>I doubt that the bullies I referenced earlier in this note have the patience nor the wisdom (yet) to appreciate what I have written in this note. I instead expect those people to not read this note and to be quick to dismiss me as some elitist snob and entitled prick who deserves to be censored off the Internet (so that the monkey boys and their lackeys can dominate cyberspace instead). It should be noted that I did not write this note primarily for my enemies (though I did write it for the general public as I do for all content which I publish through the Internet-based collection of digital files referred to as <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a>). As usual, I wrote this piece especially for my future selves (i.e. versions of karbytes which I hope and expect will be fortunate enough to be able to re-visit this document indefinitely many times and indefinitely far out into the future starting from where I am today at approximately 6:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 01_JULY_2024).
